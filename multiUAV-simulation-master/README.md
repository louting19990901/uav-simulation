## multiUAV Simulation in OMNeT++

* Stationary, mobile and airborne nodes (UAVs,...)
* Charging stations
* Mission control
* MAVLink commands based flight planning
* Energy consumption simulation
* Energy maintenance operations
* Optimization
* Visualization

### Preparation

Boost is needed by this program. Please download here: http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_55_0.html
Copy the folder `boost` into the subdirectory `include-boost` of the OMNeT++ base directory.

Example Result: `C:\omnetpp-5.4\include-boost\boost\version.hpp`

### Running the simulation

![scenario example](SzenarioGabelbachMapMissionsP2PHover.png "Scenario Gabelbach Example")

#### Running in OMNeT++ IDE

In subdirectory `./run_config` you can find predefined run and debug configuration ready to go with OMNeT++ IDE.

All launches are preconfigured to run the Gabelbach scenario.
* `multiUAV-simulation cmdenv.launch` ðŸ¡º launches all runs without user interface (i.e. QTenv), that includes interating over all replacement modes and repeat for 10 times
* `multiUAV-simulation cmdenv (0).launch` ðŸ¡º launches without user interface Run 0, i.e. replacement mode 0 and no repetition
* `multiUAV-simulation debug.launch` ðŸ¡º launches the simulation with user interface, with debug information (should be run as debug) and Run 0
* `multiUAV-simulation release.launch` ðŸ¡º launches the simulation with user interface in release state and Run 0

### Results

Results for Gabelbach scenario will be placed in subdirectory `./results`. Depending on your launch configuration, you will find a different amount of output files. However, for each successfully finished simulation run, there should be following files:
- `*.elog`: Eventlog
- `*.out`: everything written to the ouput console
- `*.sca`: scalar results that include the final results including the six main figures:
  - `utilizationEnergyOverdrawMaintenance`
  - `utilizationEnergyOverdrawMission`
  - `utilizationEnergyMaintenance`
  - `utilizationEnergyMission`
  - `utilizationSecMaintenance`
  - `utilizationSecMission`
